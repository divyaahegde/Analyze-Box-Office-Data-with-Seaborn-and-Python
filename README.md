# Analyze-Box-Office-Data-with-Seaborn-and-Python
Welcome to this project based on Analyzing Worldwide Box Office Revenue with Seaborn and Python.  In this project we will be working with the The Movie Database (TMDB) Box Office Prediction data set. Can we build models to accurately predict movie revenue?  Could the results from these models be used to further increase revenue?  We try to answer these questions by way of exploratory data analysis (EDA) in this project. We will be using a statistical data visualization library like Seaborn..
